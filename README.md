# RegressLab: Interactive Linear Regression Pipeline

RegressLab is an interactive Streamlit web application designed to guide students, researchers, and practitioners through the end-to-end process of building and analyzing a linear regression model from tabular data.

Deployed Dashboard URL: https://regresslab-interactive-linear-regression-pipeline.streamlit.app/

## Features

- **Data Upload & Quality Checks**: Easily upload CSV datasets, with automatic detection and handling of missing values and duplicates.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualize distributions, check skewness and kurtosis, and analyze correlations with intuitive plots.
- **Outlier Treatment & Transformation**: Interactive options to remove or clip outliers and apply transformations (log, square root) on selected variables.
- **Customizable Feature Scaling**: Multiple scaling options including Standardization (Z-score), Min-Max, and Robust scaling.
- **Manual Gradient Descent**: Core linear regression training implemented manually with support for L1, L2, Elastic Net regularization and convergence criteria.
- **Train-Test Split & Evaluation**: Split data into customizable training and testing sets with comprehensive manual evaluation metrics (MSE, RMSE, MAE, RÂ², MAPE).
- **3D Visualization**: Explore the learned regression hyperplane visually for any pair of selected features, alongside actual data points.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

`git clone https://github.com/yourusername/regresslab.git
cd regresslab`

2. Install required dependencies:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. Run the Streamlit app:

`streamlit run app.py`


## Usage

- Upload your dataset or choose the default sample dataset.
- Select your target and feature variables.
- Perform exploratory analysis and apply transformations as needed.
- Select feature scaling and configure training parameters.
- Train the model via manual gradient descent while monitoring progress.
- Visualize the regression plane and data through interactive 3D plots.
- Evaluate model performance on both training and testing datasets.

## Notes

- This app is ideal for educational purposes and gaining an intuitive understanding of linear regression workflows.
- The codebase purposefully implements key ML components manually for transparency and learning.
- For production or large-scale applications, consider using optimized ML libraries.
